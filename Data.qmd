The analysis utilizes three main types of satellite data from Google Earth Engine and one self uploaded shapefile:

## **Study Area**  
  
   - Center point: Mount Everest (86.9252°E, 27.98833°N)  
     
   - Analysis buffer: 10-15km radius  
     
   - Includes multiple climbing routes (shapefile import from private asset)
   
   ```js
   var routes = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-wbwhaha/assets/Everest");
   ```

## **Temperature Data**  
  
   - Source:  
     - MODIS MOD11A2 dataset  
       
   - Temporal resolution: 8-day composite  
     
   - Spatial resolution: 1km  
     
   - Time period: February 18, 2011 - March 30, 2025  
     
   - Variables:
     - Daytime Land Surface Temperature (LST_Day_1km)
     - Nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST_Night_1km)  
       
   - Data processing: Raw values are converted to Celsius by multiplying by 0.02 and subtracting 273.15

## **Terrain Data**  
  
   - Source:
     - USGS/SRTMGL1_003 dataset
     - NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001 dataset  
       
   - Spatial resolution: 30m  
     
   - Variables:
     - Slope (identifying steep areas >20 degrees)
     - Aspect (terrain orientation)
     - Elevation profiles for climbing routes

## **Snow Cover Data**

   - Source: 
     - Sentinel-2 imagery  
       
   - Temporal resolution: 5-10 days (depending on satellite overpasses)  
     
   - Spatial resolution: 10m (Bands 3, 4, 8) and 20m (Band 11)  
     
   - Time period: January 2015 - Present  
     
   - Variables:
     - Band 3 (Green): Used in NDSI calculation to detect snow
     - Band 11 (SWIR): Used in NDSI calculation to detect snow
     - Snow Class: Derived from the NDSI and snow fraction (classified into 4 categories: < 25%, 25–50%, 50–75%, > 75% snow cover)  
       
   - Data processing:  
     - NDSI is calculated using the formula:
    $$ \text{NDSI} = \frac{\text{Band 3} - \text{Band 11}}{\text{Band 3} + \text{Band 11}} $$
    
     - Snow fraction is calculated using a neighborhood mean reducer over a 10-pixel radius
     - Snow cover classes are derived by categorizing the snow percentage into four classes
