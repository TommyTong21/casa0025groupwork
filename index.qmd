# Project Summary

The Everest Climbing Planner currently displays around 10 unique climbing routes radiating from a central base camp location.

The green route is identified as the safest, likely due to minimal overlap with high-snow areas.

The yellow route, currently selected, appears moderately safe but still crosses several medium-snow zones.

Red routes indicate other viable but potentially riskier paths, some of which traverse high-snow regions (>75% coverage).

These visual insights help climbers and planners assess not just route direction and distance, but also the seasonal safety based on snow cover severity.
